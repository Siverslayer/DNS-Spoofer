# DNS Spoofer

The DNS Spoofer is a tool designed for manipulating DNS responses to redirect traffic from one domain to another, spoofing DNS records for malicious purposes.

## Introduction

DNS spoofing is a technique used to falsify DNS records in order to redirect traffic from legitimate domains to malicious ones. The DNS Spoofer tool automates this process, allowing attackers to intercept and manipulate DNS responses to redirect users to fake websites or servers.

## Features

- **DNS Record Manipulation:** Modify DNS responses to redirect traffic to a specified IP address or domain.
- **Custom Spoofed Records:** Create custom DNS records to spoof specific domains or subdomains.
- **Phishing Attacks:** Redirect users to fake login pages or phishing websites to steal sensitive information.
- **DNS Cache Poisoning:** Inject spoofed DNS records into DNS caches to persistently redirect traffic.
- **MitM Attacks:** Perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks by intercepting DNS requests and responses.

## Usage

1. **Target Selection:** Specify the target domain or domains whose DNS responses will be spoofed.
2. **Spoofed Records:** Create or modify DNS records to spoof the desired domains or subdomains.
3. **Initiate Spoofing:** Start the DNS Spoofer and monitor DNS traffic to intercept and manipulate DNS responses.
4. **Verify Redirection:** Confirm that traffic is being redirected as intended by visiting the spoofed domains or monitoring network traffic.

## Warning

DNS spoofing is illegal and unethical when used without proper authorization. This tool should only be used for legitimate security testing purposes on systems you are authorized to access. Unauthorized use may result in legal consequences.
